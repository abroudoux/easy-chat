# EasyChat

EasyChat is a school exam project where I had to imagine a fictional product and make supports as part of its release. I created EasyChat, a virtual assistant generate by an IA  that works locally. I created a website consisting of a Landing page and a Contact page.
The restrictions were :
- Use HTML/CSS
- Use JavaScript
- Use PHP

## Development

I decided to use SCSS, a CSS preprocessor which allow me to save time for the rest of my project.
I also gave myself another challenge: connecting the info collected by my form in a MySQl database.
